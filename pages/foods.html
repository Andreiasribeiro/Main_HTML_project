    <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable
        diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars
        and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>
