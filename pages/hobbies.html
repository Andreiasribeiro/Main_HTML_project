    <p>Having hobbies can lower anxiety, lower your stress level, and help cope with depression. Hobbies help you form a
        life outside of work. You are just relaxing and doing something you enjoy without any of the pressures of the
        outside world. You don't have to do something as structured as you would at work or school</p>
